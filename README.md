## Data description

1. Number of Instances: 517

2. Number of Attributes: 12 + output attribute

   Note: several of the attributes may be correlated, thus it makes sense to apply some sort of feature selection.

3. Attribute information:

   For more information, read [Cortez and Morais, 2007].

   1. X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
   2. Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
   3. month - month of the year: "jan" to "dec"
   4. day - day of the week: "mon" to "sun"
   5. FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
   6. DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3
   7. DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6
   8. ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
   9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
   10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100
   11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40
   12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4
   13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84 (this output variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make sense to model with the logarithm transform).
